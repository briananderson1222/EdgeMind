# Hypothesis: Investigative Insights Architecture Decision

Parent decision context for how to enable the AI agent to perform deep investigative analysis on factory data rather than surface-level metric reporting. The chosen approach must enable correlation analysis, root cause identification, and actionable recommendations.

## Rationale
{"anomaly": "AI agent produces shallow insights that restate metrics instead of investigating root causes", "approach": "Evaluate architectural options for enabling deeper data investigation", "alternatives_rejected": []}
