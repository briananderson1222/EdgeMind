# Hypothesis: Navbar Design Strategy Decision

Decision context for how to design and implement the EdgeMind navigation bar. Groups competing approaches for navbar structure, visual design, and interaction patterns. The chosen approach must support: (1) persona-based view switching (COO, Plant Manager), (2) demo control panel, (3) manufacturing view iframes, (4) agent workflow visualization, (5) iterative static HTML/CSS prototyping before integration.

## Rationale
{"anomaly": "Single-page dashboard has no navigation structure. ProveIt! demo requires seamless persona switching and multi-view support. Need iterative design approach with static prototyping before implementation.", "approach": "Group competing navbar design strategies under a decision context for systematic evaluation", "alternatives_rejected": []}
