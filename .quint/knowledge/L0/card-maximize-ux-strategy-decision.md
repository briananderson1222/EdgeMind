# Hypothesis: Card Maximize UX Strategy Decision

Decision context for how users should trigger card maximization in the EdgeMind dashboard. Key considerations: (1) Cards contain interactive elements (buttons, filters, inputs) that need to remain clickable, (2) All cards should support maximize, not just AI Agent, (3) Pattern should be discoverable but not intrusive, (4) Must work on both desktop and touch devices.

## Rationale
{"anomaly": "Maximize button doesn't render on AI Agent card, and user wants any card to be maximizable with intuitive UX", "approach": "Evaluate competing UX patterns for card expansion", "alternatives_rejected": []}
