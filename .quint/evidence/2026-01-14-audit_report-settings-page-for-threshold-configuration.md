WLNK: uncalibrated-business-thresholds → missing-domain-context-hypothesis (L0). R_eff: 0.00 due to transitive dependency on unverified L0. Self score: 1.00 - feasibility confirmed. ISSUE: Same as uncalibrated-business-thresholds - dependency chain includes L0 hypothesis. Risk: Implementation risk is LOW (patterns exist), but R_eff is penalized by dependency chain.
