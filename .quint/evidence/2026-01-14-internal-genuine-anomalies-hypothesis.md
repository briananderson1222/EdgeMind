VALIDATED against domain-context.js thresholds. Enterprise A defects at 2500 exceed critical threshold of 25/hr by 100x. Enterprise B aggregated availability at 72% but per-machine availability ranges 47%-93% (some machines ARE problematic). The AI IS correctly identifying threshold violations - issue is repetition and lack of business calibration, not detection accuracy.
