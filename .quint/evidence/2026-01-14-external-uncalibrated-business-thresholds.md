USER CONFIRMED: Boss says 85% OEE is 'world class'. AI flagging 72% availability as 'concerning' is inappropriate for this business context. domain-context.js thresholds (defects warning=10, critical=25) are not calibrated to actual expectations. User confirmed this is ProveIt hackathon dummy data - no 'real' business thresholds exist yet. Settings page needed for calibration.
