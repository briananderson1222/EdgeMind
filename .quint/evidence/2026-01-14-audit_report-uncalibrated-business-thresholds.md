WLNK: missing-domain-context-hypothesis (L0, R:0.00). R_eff: 0.00 due to dependency on unverified L0 hypothesis. Bias Check: None. ISSUE: Dependency was declared to show conceptual relationship but missing-domain-context-hypothesis was REFINED not PROMOTED. Self score is 1.00 - hypothesis is valid, dependency chain is the problem. RECOMMENDATION: This hypothesis supersedes missing-domain-context-hypothesis, dependency should be removed or L0 promoted.
